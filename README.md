#### As a user:
- I want to register/login securely, so my data is protected.
- I want to add new clients to the system quickly, so I can manage my contacts efficiently.
- I want to search for clients by name, so I can find specific information easily.
- I want to view my clients in a clean, intuitive layout for quick navigation.

### Wireframes
Wireframes were created using **Balsamiq** to visualize the initial design and layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
