## User Experience Design

### User Stories
#### As a user:
- I want to register/login securely, so my data is protected.
- I want to add new clients to the system quickly, so I can manage my contacts efficiently.
- I want to search for clients by name, so I can find specific information easily.
- I want to view my clients in a clean, intuitive layout for quick navigation.

#### As an administrator:
- I want to ensure only authenticated users can access sensitive features like adding clients.
- I want to paginate results for better performance and usability.

### Wireframes
Wireframes were created using **Balsamiq** to visualize the initial design and layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop views.
