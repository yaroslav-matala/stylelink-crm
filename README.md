![Am I Responsive Design](https://github.com/yaroslav-matala/stylelink-crm/blob/main/static/readme_images/amiresponsive.png)

### Overview

This project is a client management web application built with Django. It allows users to add, view, update, and delete client information in a secure and organized manner. The app includes a dashboard where users can manage their clients, search through records, and paginate results. The project is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, with a focus on accessibility and responsive design. It incorporates authentication, ensuring that only authorized users can access their own data.

The app will be deployed on Heroku, making it accessible to users from anywhere. Future updates include the addition of a walkthrough guide for new users, as well as additional features to improve usability.

### Site User and Goal

- **Target Users**:  
  The primary users of this site are individuals or businesses that need to manage client information, such as small business owners, consultants, and freelancers. The system is designed to be simple enough for non-technical users while providing powerful features for managing client records.

- **Goal**:  
  The goal of this project is to provide a straightforward, secure, and efficient way for users to manage their clients' information. It aims to streamline the process of adding, updating, and deleting client records while ensuring data privacy and security. Additionally, the application will evolve to include a user-friendly walkthrough guide to assist users in navigating the platform with ease.

## Database Planning

The application uses a relational database to store client information. The database is built using **PostgreSQL** and consists of the following tables:

# Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
![Entity Relationship Diagram](https://github.com/yaroslav-matala/stylelink-crm/blob/main/static/readme_images/stylelink-erd.png)

## User Table
| Field         | Type      | Description                       |
|---------------|-----------|-----------------------------------|
| `id`          | Primary Key (PK) | Auto-generated unique identifier |
| `username`    | String    | Username of the user              |
| `password`    | String    | Password for the user             |
| `email`       | String    | Email of the user                 |
| `date_joined` | DateTime | Date the user registered          |

## Client Table
| Field         | Type      | Description                              |
|---------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| `id`          | Primary Key (PK) | Auto-generated unique identifier        |
| `user`        | Foreign Key (FK) | References `User` table (One-to-Many)    |
| `name`        | String    | Name of the client                       |
| `phone`       | String    | Phone number of the client (optional)    |
| `email`       | String    | Email of the client (optional)           |
| `location`    | String    | Location of the client (optional)        |
| `formula`     | Text      | Formula stored here (optional)           |
| `notes`       | Text      | Additional notes or comments (optional)  |
| `price`       | Decimal   | Price associated with client (optional)  |
| `created_at`  | DateTime  | Date the client was created              |
| `updated_at`  | DateTime  | Date the client was last updated         |

## Relationship:
- **One-to-Many**: A `User` can have many `Clients`, but each `Client` is associated with exactly one `User`.

#### Database Relationships

- **User-Client Relationship**: The `Client` model has a foreign key linking to the `User` model. This ensures that clients are associated with specific users, and users can only access and manage their own client data.
  
#### Indexing

- **Client Name Index**: An index is applied to the `name` field for faster search and filtering of client names in the dashboard.

#### Data Integrity

- **Validation**: The application performs validation checks to ensure data integrity, such as ensuring that all required fields (name, phone, etc.) are provided when creating or updating client records.
- **Cascade Deletion**: When a user is deleted from the system, all related client records will also be deleted to maintain referential integrity.

#### Database Migration

Djangoâ€™s built-in migration system will be used to create and manage the database schema. This allows for easy version control of the database and ensures that changes to the models are automatically reflected in the database structure.

## Known Bugs

### Issue with Allauth Signup Page

- **Description**: The password hint section in the Allauth signup page includes an `<ul>` tag nested inside a `<small>` tag. This structure does not pass HTML validation, as the `<ul>` element is not allowed as a child of the `<small>` element.
  
- **Impact**: While this does not break the functionality of the signup page, it does result in HTML validation errors.

- **Potential Solution**: A possible fix would involve overriding the Allauth signup template and adjusting the structure to ensure the `<ul>` tag is placed outside of the `<small>` tag or replaced with a semantically valid alternative.

- **Status**: This issue is currently under review and will be addressed in a future update.

If you encounter this bug, feel free to open an issue or suggest a solution in the repository.
